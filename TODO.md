# TODO: Show Cart Total in Payment Page

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Edit location.html: Update the checkout function to calculate the total amount and store it in localStorage as "checkoutAmount" before redirecting to address.html.
- [x] Edit payment.html: Add a prominent display for the total amount in the payment-container, outside of the payment method selection, so it's always visible. Update the script to fetch and display the amount.
- [x] Test the flow: Navigate from menu.html to location.html (cart), add items, proceed to address.html, then to payment.html, and verify the total is displayed correctly.
- [x] Verify updates: Ensure the total updates based on cart contents and is accurate in payment.html.
